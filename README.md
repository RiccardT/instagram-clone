# Instagram Clone
An Android app with janky Instagram-esque functionality, that I created purely for practice purposes :)

Things I learned
------------------
- Using AWS EC-2 With Parse Server

  I created the backend entirely using AWS Parse Server, and it was amazing! I had a fully functional MongoDB database and web server with authentication,           authorization, a dashboard, and a rich Android library to boot :)
  
- Grabbing Files from the Android File System
- Adding Listeners via class Extension versus using XML
- Basic I/O Async in Android
- Android Keyboard Management
